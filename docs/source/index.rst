Welcome to NRGlab's documentation for NRGQT pymol plug-in!
===================================

NRGQT is a pymol plug-in for molecular docking and virtual screening using NRGdock, GetCleft, FlexAID and Surfaces. This plug-in was created to facilitate the use the tools developed in Najmanovich's Reseach Group and was inspired in the NRG suite pymol plug-in (ref) for FlexAID.

The plug-in counts with a variaty of functionalities: Binding site defition, docking simulations with FlexAID and NRGdock, high-throughput screening with NRGdock using the Chemical Component Dictionary (CCD) and the dataset of all approved drugs of DrugBank and ligand interaction visualization using surfaces.
