Surfaces
======

Surfaces (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/10/btad608/7288175 ) comprises a collection of Python scripts that provide a rapid means to assess protein interactions by analyzing the atomic surface areas in contact and the types of atoms involved in the interaction.
Surfaces is fully implemented in NRGSuite-QT and can be applied to protein-protein and ligand-protein interactions calculations.

Surfaces to protein-ligand interactions
-------

.. note::
    In order to run surfaces to calculate ligand-protein interactions, the ligand and the target must be loaded in PyMOL in a single object.



Select surfaces in the main menu on the left corner of the plug-in. Press 'Refresh' and select the FlexAID result in 'Result to run surfaces on' list. Press the button 'Run Surfaces'.

The visual of surfaces will be shown in the PyMOL window.
