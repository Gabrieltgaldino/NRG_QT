Single Mutations
================

The "Single Mutations" functionality (SMF) is used to create single mutants using Modeller, implemented using their template for the Mutate model (for more information see: https://salilab.org/modeller/wiki/Mutate_model )

In order to use SMF a selection containing the residue (or residues) to mutate must be previously defined in pymol. Press "Refresh" in the "Load" area and select the object containing the protein of interest in the "Object to mutate" list. Choose the selection containing the residues to mutate in the "Selected residue (s)" list.
