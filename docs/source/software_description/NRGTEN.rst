=======

NRGTEN (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/19/3369/6179106?login=false) is a python package for Normal Mode Analysis calculations using the ENCoM potential (
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003569). NRGTEN can be applied for the calculation of Dynamical Signatures and Conformational ensembles of proteins and protein ligand complexes.

An object containing all molecules to be considered for the dynamical signature calculations must be loaded in the pymol interface.
.. note::
    We recommend that the user use the function "Remove solvent" from pymol before using NRGTEN in order to avoid errors.
