Tutorial
=====

For this tutorial, we will be reproducing the results of Gu S. et al. 2018 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25790-1 ).
In their work they searched in a data set of FDA approved drugs inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A4 (EphA4).
This receptor was identified as a molecular target for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). They selected and tested 22 molecules found 5 potential inhibitors of EphA4.
Specifically, nilotinib (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB04868 ), a kinase inhibitor, inhibited the binding of EphA4 and ephrin-A at micromolar scale in a dosage-dependent manner.
In this tutorial, we are going to use a structure of EphA4 (PDB code: 2wo2, https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2WO2 ), same structure Gu S. et. al. used in their work.

Preparing the target
------------

Open pymol and run the command:

.. code-block:: console
    fetch 2wo2

The structure of the target should appear in pymol window.
We now follow the preparation steps for the docking, removing the EPHRIN-B2 chain and removing water molecules.
Run the command:

.. code-block:: console
    remove chain B
    remove solvent

Open the plug-in
